# Jules Antigravity Lattice Sentinel

An AI-native repository designed with the **AI as an Amplifier** philosophy. This system manages atomic deployments of lattice nodes with high integrity, built through strict Test-Driven Development (TDD).

## 🚀 Core Philosophy

This repository follows the **Red-Green-Refactor** mandate. Every feature is treated as a contract between the developer and the AI agent (Antigravity/Jules), ensuring that speed never compromises architectural integrity.

### Principles:

- **Tests as a Contract**: Tests define the _intent_; code provides the _effect_.
- **Domain Integrity**: Logic is mapped through strict models (`src/domain/models.py`), preventing AI from taking "creative license" with generic patterns.
- **Architectural Observability**: Every orchestration step is audited via the `JulesAudit` service.

## 🏗️ Architecture

- **Orchestrator**: Implements the **Saga Pattern** for atomic deployments.
- **Vault**: Handles infrastructure effects with strict rollback capabilities.
- **Audit**: Provides a 'Quantum-Signature' verified audit trail for every action.

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.10+
- `pip install pytest pytest-asyncio`

### Running the Contract Verification (Tests)

```bash
python -m pytest -v tests/integration/
```

## 📜 Development Protocol

1. **Red**: Create a test in `tests/integration/` defining the new failure or success scenario.
2. **Green**: Implement the minimum logic in `src/` to satisfy the audit and vault requirements.
3. **Refactor**: Clean up the orchestration or domain models while maintaining the Green state.
